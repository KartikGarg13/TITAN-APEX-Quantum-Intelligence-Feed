# TITAN-APEX-Quantum-Intelligence-Feed
TITAN APEX is a quantum intelligence dashboard that simulates secure global routing using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It visualizes encrypted communication paths, risk scores, latency, and vulnerability levels on an animated world map. The system generates intel reports and integrates live weather data for realistic cybersecurity simulation.

TITAN APEX is an advanced Quantum Intelligence Feed dashboard that visualizes secure global network routing in real time using an interactive world map interface. The project simulates how enterprise grade encrypted communication travels between major global hubs while dynamically calculating the safest and most efficient path using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. It combines frontend engineering, algorithmic logic, and cybersecurity simulation into a single immersive product level experience.

The system models global cities as network nodes and connects them through weighted edges that represent communication links. When a user selects an origin and destination, the application initiates a simulated secure handshake using RSA 4096, AES 256 session exchange, and SHA 384 verification. After authentication, the routing engine computes the optimal path based on geographical distance while also analyzing a vulnerability index assigned to each node. This vulnerability metric is used to calculate a risk score, hops count, latency estimate, and a dynamic threat percentage.

The dashboard visually renders network edges, active data packets, and node status using HTML5 Canvas animations. Secure paths glow in cyan while compromised routes trigger intrusion detection alerts in red. The security meter dynamically updates to reflect tunnel integrity. Real time weather data is fetched using the Open Meteo API to enhance realism by displaying live environmental data for both origin and destination nodes.

An integrated Intel Report engine generates a printable forensic style network report containing timestamp, route trace, encryption suite, risk assessment, and verification hash. The report uses a dedicated print optimized layout for professional documentation output.

TITAN APEX demonstrates practical implementation of graph theory, shortest path algorithms, cybersecurity simulation concepts, real time API integration, and advanced UI animation techniques. It represents a fusion of data structures and algorithms with product focused frontend design, showcasing how theoretical computer science concepts can power visually compelling enterprise level intelligence systems.
