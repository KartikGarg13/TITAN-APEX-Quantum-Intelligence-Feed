# TITAN-APEX-Quantum-Intelligence-Feed
TITAN APEX is a quantum intelligence dashboard that simulates secure global routing using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It visualizes encrypted communication paths, risk scores, latency, and vulnerability levels on an animated world map. The system generates intel reports and integrates live weather data for realistic cybersecurity simulation.
